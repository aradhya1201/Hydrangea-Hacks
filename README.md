Project Description:

Pneumonia causes the death of around 700,000 children every year and affects 7% of the global population. Chest X-rays are primarily used for the diagnosis of this disease. However, even for a trained radiologist, it is a challenging task to examine chest X-rays. There is a need to improve the diagnosis accuracy. In this work, an efficient model for the detection of pneumonia trained on digital chest X-ray images is proposed, which could aid the radiologists in their decision making process. 

Dataset Used: https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia

There are two models

1. Trained using Teachable Machine 
    Model of Google

2. Machine Learning model trained locally 
    It is a image classifier model that can classify whether a atient have pneumonia or not using X-ray.
